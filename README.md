# 2050-C-Labs
All the labs I've completed in CS 2050

In order to run and test go into any terminal with GCC installed and type:

``gcc main.c labx.c labx.h -Wall -Werror``

This will compile the specified program and to run just type:

``./a.out``

Any questions just put up an issue on the page. Thanks!
